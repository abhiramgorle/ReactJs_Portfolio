            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Abhiram Gorle </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Visakhapatnam, India.</span>
            <br /> 
            <br />I am a Computer Science Engineer. I am a passionate learner and a quick learner. I love exploring new technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a human species have made so far in the recent years (apart from the headphone-jack part though).
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
